# Project-Blackjack
In this project, I implement a Python simulation of a Blackjack game using object-oriented programming techniques. Blackjack is a card game typically played at casinos where each player competes against the dealer to get a score closest to 21, without going over 21. At the start of the game, each player and the dealer are given 2 cards. A person’s set of cards is referred to as their hand. The player’s own cards (their hand) are visible to themselves and only one of the dealer’s cards is visible to everyone. After everyone receives their cards, the dealer asks each player whether they would like to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current cards). Each player can hit (take a card) as many times as they would like to get their score as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Afterwards, the dealer reveals their card and decides to hit or stand. Lastly, the final scores are calculated and the winner is announced
